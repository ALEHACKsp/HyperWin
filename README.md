# Windows Hypervisor

The goal of this project is to create a small hypervisor for the Windows operating system on 32 bit. I am aiming to finish writing it in about 5 months, before I start serving in the army at Match 2021. Unfortunately, I will have enough time to work on it only at the beginning of October 2020.

I am not writing this hypervisor for any specific usage. My main motivation is to learn about the virtualization technology on x86-64 Intel processors, about Windows internals and BIOS programming.
